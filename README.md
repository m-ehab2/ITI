## Introduction

In this program, I explored the world of Full Stack development using the MEARN stack, which is a powerful combination of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, React, and Node.js. The labs provided hands-on experience in building scalable and efficient web applications, covering both frontend and backend development aspects.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific lab or project. The folder structure is designed to be intuitive, with each lab having its dedicated directory. Additionally, there might be subdirectories for frontend and backend components, making it easy to navigate and understand the codebase.
